# READ THIS PLEASE
infiny kernel isn't very stable for this moment
the version of kernel is 0.0.3
**IF YOU WANT A QUITE STABLE KERNEL WAIT AT LEAST VERSION 0.1.0**
you can still use our kernel because after all the tests the instability cannot be disturbing.

# recommandation for your distribution
- if update of kernel is available : make the update in your os(it can make the kernel more stable)
- innovat : what people like most is innovation, so innovate
- add commands : games, utilities other.....
